Even though the overall compile time was not good, it is possible to use it for running a large simulation (that may take, for example, 10 hours of CPU time).Â  It is possible to run a batch of simulations remotely using the free cloud resources.\n\nIn fact, there is no simple way to run Network Animations such as NetAnim through this facility and visualize the simulation output. However, it is possible to do quality analysis and produce graphs using the available tools of Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n\n## References\n1. https://colab.research.google.com/\n1. https://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-allinone-3.37.tar.bz2\n1. https://www.projectguideline.com/installing-and-running-ns-3-using-free-colab-cloud-platform/","metadata":{}}]}
